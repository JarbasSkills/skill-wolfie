Use Wolfram Alpha for general knowledge questions

## About
Ask general-knowledge queries of your Mycroft device.  If no other Skills can handle the _Intent_, [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com) will be queried
to see if it can find an answer.  You'll be surprised by how much it knows!

You can also explicitly request to "ask the wolf"

## Examples
* "ask the wolf what is the speed of light"
* "How tall is Mount Everest?"
* "When was The Rocky Horror Picture Show released?"
* "What is Madonna's real name?"
* "What's 18 times 4?"
* "How many inches in a meter?"
* "Send me the source on that"
